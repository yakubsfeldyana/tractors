I have a simple static website in directory "website"
It uses several html pages.
The "View Full Details" button on index.html page is left aligned.
The "Get a Quote" button is center aligned.
I want them both to be centered, aligned vertically and horizontally.
This change is only for the index.html
The alignment of the "Get a Quote" button on other pages should remain as is.
