I have a simple static website in directory "website".
Please make the following changes:
add one more page:
    john-deere-2025r.html
It should contain information about John Deere 2025r tractor

Change the layout of the top menu on all pages.
All pages should have the same simple header 
menu for navigation. 
No javascript. 
No hamburger menu.

The top navigation should be simply 
a list of several links like this:

 - Home
 - About
 - ATV Flail Mower
 - John Deere 1025r
 - John Deere 2025r

 Also on the hope page the listing of products should ve vertical. All 3 products should go one under another

 Each product should be a frame containing an image and a title and short description
