I have a simple static website in directory "website"
It uses several html pages. 
On some of product pages there is pricing.
Please remove the actual prices from the website.

So for example for page 

     john-deere-1025r.html we have:

change this:

Pricing
Base Model: Starting at $16,500
With H120 Loader: Starting at $19,800
Complete packages with mower deck available
Call for current pricing, financing options, and package deals

to simply this:

Complete packages with mower deck available
Call for current pricing, financing options, and package deals

And please do similar changes on all product pages.
