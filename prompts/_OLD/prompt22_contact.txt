I have a simple static website in directory "website"
It uses several html pages.
Create a contact form that would ask user to sumbit name, last name, phone number and email and a question. Make the name and email and question fields mandatory.
Use web3forms to build the form.
Have the email go to yakubsfeld.yana@gmail.com
The key is 3e038e18-c37e-4900-b114-3d59027e1eab
Add this contact page to navigation and nav_load.js
