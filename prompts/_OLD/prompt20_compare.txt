I have a simple static website in directory "website"
It uses several html pages.
I want you to create a new page called "compare".
On this page, I want to compare the 6 tractors on the home page. Here is the information
John Deere Compact Tractor Size Comparison
Here is the file with the summary of how each John Deere tractor model differs from the previous, smaller model in the list, with all the links @~/Users/yanayakubsfeld/docs/202507_tractors
Add the images to each, the images are located here: @~/Users/yanayakubsfeld/docs/202507_tractors/website/images

Add the page to navigation
