containing information about the product:
Name, short description, 3 images and a 2-3 embedded videos

All pages should have the same header.
The top menu should list all pages for navigation.

No javascript. 
No hamburger menu.

The top navigation should be simply 
a list of several links like this:

Also on the home page the listing of products should ve vertical. 
All products should go one under another

Each product should be in a frame containing an image and a title and short description
Clicking on it should switch to corresponding product page.
