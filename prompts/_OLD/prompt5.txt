I have a simple static website in directory "website".
It currently uses only html and css.
It also uses javascript to load navigation at the top of pages.
But this navigation is not loaded if I open the site locally by simply double-clicking on index.html. This is because of CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions.

Please implement the following solution: JavaScript Template with Fallback

- Keep the current fetch approach but add a fallback
- If fetch fails, inject the navigation HTML directly via JavaScript
- This maintains the single-source navigation while ensuring local compatibility
- Pros: Works both locally and on servers, single navigation source
- Cons: Slightly more complex JavaScript
