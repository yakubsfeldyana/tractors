Excavator Safety Guide
Jul. 26 2024

It's no wonder why excavators are found on thousands of farms and construction sites around the world. Excavators are powerful yet versatile, making them a useful tool in a variety of different circumstances. However, like all tools, there is the potential for harm if these vehicles are misused. That's why the experts at Mullally Tractor Sales have created this excavator safety guide.

Before Operation
Even before you actually start the excavator itself, there are several things that you can do to ensure safe operation. Even doing something as simple as cleaning and readjusting the excavator's mirrors can help make things safer. As with all heavy equipment, an excavator should undergo a safety inspection before each usage. If there are any underground utility lines or other structures that should be avoided, the operator needs to be made aware of them. If you're not sure where these underground structures are, have the local utility company mark them for you. Beyond that, the excavator operator should follow basic safety procedures such as wearing a seatbelt at all times. 

During Operation
When the time comes to actually operate the excavator, it's important that a few key safety rules are observed. For example, no one should be allowed to ride in the excavator's bucket or in the cab without a seatbelt. The operator should stay aware of their surroundings at all times. If they notice obstacles, people, animals, or rough terrain in the way, the operator should move slower until they have maneuvered around the hazard. Speaking of rough terrain, the excavator operator should stick to flat and even ground whenever possible. Finally, it's important to keep the excavator's bucket low when transporting materials or tackling slopes. Never attempt to dig under the excavator itself. 

After Operation
It's safest to park an excavator on level ground with the bucket lowered. If the operator is done using the excavator for the day, it's recommended that they turn off the auto-idle switch and run the engine at half throttle for a few minutes. This will give the turbocharger a chance to cool down. Once the turbocharger has cooled, the operator should set the ROM to low idle and shut off the engine. Don't forget to lock the equipment up for the night!

Benefits of Buying a Used Lawn Mower
Jul. 24 2024
Used Lawn Mower Buying Guide 

Buying a used lawn mower makes it easy to find a quality model for an affordable price. The used lawn mower market is full of great models with a lot of life left in them. If you're interested in learning more about the benefits of buying a used lawn mower, check out this guide from Mullally Tractor Sales Inc.

Save Money
The most obvious benefit of buying a used lawn mower is the price. Used lawn mowers cost less than new ones due to depreciation. If you need a lawn mower but you're on a tight budget, buying used is probably your best bet. 

Durable Construction
One concern that many potential used lawn mower buyers have is that the used mower won't last as long as a new model. While this is true to an extent, lawn mowers are generally built to be durable and long-lasting. Many used lawn mowers are still in fairly good condition and have years of service left in them. If you inspect the used lawn mower to check for potential mechanical issues and take a close look at the maintenance history, you won't be taken off guard by unforeseen maintenance issues. 

Explore More Choices
Another advantage of purchasing a used lawn mower is that buying a used mower makes exploring your options easier. This is partially due to the lower sticker price, which means there's a lower barrier to entry. You don't have to risk as much if you decide to try out a model that's a bit different from what you usually use. Since used mowers depreciate slower than new ones, you'll also be able to recoup more of your investment if you decide that the model you purchase isn't for you.

How to Increase Mower Service Life
May. 2 2024
Maintenance

On average, lawnmowers are expected to last for at least 6 to 10 years even with heavy-duty use and wear. However, to get the full length of your model's service life, you'll need to stay on top of its general maintenance and upkeep. For tips on how to ensure your mower stays in working condition for years to come, check out our article below.

Sharpen The Blade
Your mower's blade is one of its most important components. A sharp blade will allow your mower to run smoothly, cut efficiently, and save you a lot of wear and tear on your equipment. However, lawn mower blades will go dull much sooner than you realize. You'll want to sharpen your blade every 20 to 25 hours or mow time and replace it completely annually.

Perform an Oil Change
Just like any other piece of equipment, your lawn mower will need to have its oil changed regularly to keep the engine from getting gummed up and ensure your machinery runs smoothly. This should be done twice a year or after 50 hours of service time.

Clean Your Mower
To keep dirt and debris from building up on your mower and corroding important components, be sure to give your model a good scrub every 6 months or so. However, don't forget to give your model a quick rinse in between each mow as well, making sure to rinse away grass and dirt from the blades. Afterward, make sure your mower has dried completely before placing it away in your shed or garage.

Utility Tractor Benefits
Mar. 29 2024
Buying Guide

Utility tractors are perfect for smaller farms that don't need a full-sized tractor but would still benefit from the power and versatility that a tractor brings. If you operate a smaller farming operation and you think a utility tractor might be for you, this guide from Mullally Tractor Sales Inc. has more information about the benefits of owning a utility tractor. 

A Useful Middle Ground
Farm tractors are designed for maximum towing power. Even smaller models tend to be very big and bulky, which can be a hassle when it comes to storage, maintenance, and other such concerns. This is especially true on smaller properties where the power of a full-sized tractor might not even be needed. Compare that to garden or lawn tractors, which are a lot smaller but are also much less powerful and might not be able to handle the needs of a smaller farming operation. Utility tractors are in-between farm tractors and garden tractors in terms of both size and power. In other words, they're easier to store than a farm tractor but are capable of doing more work than a garden tractor.

Affordable
Smaller tractors require less materials to build than larger ones, which is why utility tractors are cheaper than farm tractors. They also tend to be a lot more fuel efficient and easy to maintain. These factors make utility tractors ideal for farmers on a tight budget. 

Adaptable
Most utility tractors are compatible with a variety of different attachments and implements, much like farm tractors. This allows utility tractors to fulfill a variety of different roles around the farm. This adaptability is another reason why utility tractors are so economical.

Should You Rent or Buy Your Farm Equipment?
Nov. 16 2023
Benefits Of Farm Equipment Rentals 
When To Rent Farm Equipment

In need of some durable farm equipment to help out around your property? Then you may be considering renting your equipment rather than buying it. While both options have their advantages, some buyers will benefit from rental options more than others. To ensure you're making the right choice for your farm, we recommend reading through our helpful advice below. 

When to Rent Your Farm Equipment 
The length of time and the frequency with which you would use a piece of farm equipment are the most important factors to consider when deciding whether or not to rent machinery. If you plan to use your equipment very infrequently—even if you're using it for a months-long project—it's likely more affordable to rent a model rather than purchase one. While the rental payments will add up over time, they're unlikely to reach the same price as the model's sales tag, and you have the added benefit of being off the hook for long-term expenses—such as maintenance and insurance fees. 

When to Buy Your Farm Equipment 
 While rental fees are unlikely to add up to a model's total sticker price, you also don't want to pour too much of your money into a machine you'll never own. If you're renting a piece of farm equipment more than 3 times a year—even for short periods of time—it's likely more cost-effective to simply purchase a model of your own than continuously pay to rent out the model whenever you need it. 

Whether you're looking to buy or rent your next piece of farm equipment, we encourage you to shop with us here at Mullally Tractor Sales! Our location here in Jeffersonville, NY offers an enormous collection of top-quality models available for you to purchase or rent, and we proudly serve the nearby regions of Ulster County, NY, Delaware County, NY, and Wayne County, PA.
