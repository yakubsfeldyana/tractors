I have a simple static website in directory "website"
It uses several html pages.
On top of each page we have a header
containing business name, address, and phone and email.
Like this:

Mullally Tractor Sales
4510 State Route 52, Jeffersonville, NY 12748
Phone: (845) 482-5222 | Email: mullallytractor@gmail.com

Please remove the address and phoen/email from the header.
They are not needed at the top, because they are provided at the bottom of all pages.

So at the top we should have only company name:

Mullally Tractor Sales

Please make a blue horizontal band at the top,
and put company name in it in white font.
Make this font different from the font used in the
body of the pages.
====================================================
Please change the font of the header.
Try this:

font-family: "Arial, sans-serif"; 
font-weight: 600;
====================================================
Please change the width of the menu which appears when i click on the hamburger icon.
Currently it takes the whole width of the screen.
Make it take only the width necessary to show the menu.
If the hamburger icon on the right - then the menu should
only appear on the right.
====================================================
When I open the website locally by double-clicking on index.html,
I still see the address and emal/phone lines in the header.
Please remove these lines from the header
====================================================
On the bottom of pages we have a banner with text

   Â© 2025 Mullally Tractor Sales. All rights reserved.

Please change the background color of this banner from green to the blue.
Use the same blue we use for the banner at the top.

Also in the middle of some content pages we have banners with white font
on dark green background. Please change this background to the same
blue as the header banner
====================================================
Attached is the screen shot of the top of the page on my mobile phone.
You can see that the hamburger icon is pressed to the bottom of the top blue banner. 
Can you please vertically align it to be in the center (between top and bottom of the banner).
====================================================
