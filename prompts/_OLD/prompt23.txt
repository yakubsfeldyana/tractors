I have a simple static website in directory "website"
It uses several html pages.
The homepage index.html lists multiple products and each product has a separate product page.
There are 6 tractors and 5 chapman machines. Tractors are listed from the smallest to the biggest one.
I also have compare.html page which lists the same 6 tractors in the same order, but has textual descriptions explaining the differences between the models.
I want these decsriptions from compare.html to be copied to the homepage to the corresponding tractors and the compare.html page then can be removed from the navigation.
The website can be envoked by doubleclicking on index.html or by using test_server.py
Please check that the navigation is fixed for both cases.
==========================================================
On the compare.html, there is a "View Full Details" button for each of the tractors.
Please add these buttons to the homepage to all the products (tractors and chapman)
Clicking on this button should take the user to the corresponding product page.
=======================================================
plesae make the text on the  "View Full Details" buttons white.
==========================================================
when I test using test_server.py I see the compare.html is not in the navigation.
But when I test by double-clicking index.html the compare.html is still in the navigation.
Please remove it from the navigation and please remove the compare.html file.
