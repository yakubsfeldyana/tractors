I want to create a static website.
I have registered domain:  tractors-mowers.com
The site will present this business:

Mullally Tractor Sales
4510 State Route 52
Jeffersonville, NY 12748
Phone: (845) 482-5222
Email: mts1@hvc.rr.com

The website should be static and very simple.
All images should be in "images" directory.
Home page is index.html
All styles should be in one styles.css file.
We should about.html page.
And a lot of product pages named after specific products.

All pages should have the same simple header menu for navigation. No javascript. no hamburger menu.
The top navigation can be simply several links like this:

Home
About
Product1
Product2
...

The home page should have a vertical list of products/services. Each listing should contain a small image and a title. Clicking on image/title should open a detailed page for this product or service. 

Adding product to the website is easy. Add a page and add a listing on the home page.

Each detailed page should have the same navigation menu at the top as the home page.

The website should NOT use node.js or any other server-side scripting. And no client-side javascript.

The website should only use html and css.

We will start with 2 product pages:
   ATV Flail Mower 
   https://chapmanmachinery.com/flail-mowers/

   John Deere Sub-compact tractor 1025R
   https://www.deere.com/en/tractors/compact-tractors/1-series-sub-compact-tractors/1025r/

Each page should contain:
   Model name
   short description/specs
   one or more images
   one or more youtube videos
   price
   how to order info (call/email)
