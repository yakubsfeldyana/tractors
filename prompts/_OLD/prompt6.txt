I have a simple static website in directory "website".
It currently uses only html and css.
It also uses javascript to load navigation at the top of pages.
But this javascript is invoked only at the end of the html page.
This causes blinking at the laod time.
First the page is loaded without navigation,
then all content is loaded, and only then the navigation is loaded at the top.

Please move the navigation loading to the very top of the html body
in all content pages.
