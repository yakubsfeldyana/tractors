I have a simple static website in directory "website"
It uses several html pages.

The top of the pages uses the same header and menu.
Please do the following changes to the header and menu.

Please remove green background.
Make font green and background white

The menu items (Home, About, ...) - make them look as simple underlined links

When the screen becomes narrow - please change the menu to a hamburger-style menu.

Please always load the menu (normal or hamburger) 
by invoking javascript function at the top of the body of the page.
===============================================
I can now see the hamburger - but when I click on it - nothing happens. 
It is not responding. 

Also the hamburger should be at the very top of the window. 
Above the header (or at the same level - but at the side).

Also the page fonts of the header are too big and 
vertical spacing between lines is too big too. Please "Compress" them.
===============================================
The hamburger menu now works! This is good.
And I see that you have made the top header smaller.
But the hamburger menu is still below the header, which is not right.
The hamburger menu should be above everything else when it appears
===============================================
Please decrease the line spacing in navigation menus,
in normal and in narrow screens. 
Compress them vertically as much as possible
===============================================
It is better now. But please decrease the vertical 
spacing between navigation items even further. 
Also in the main content of all pages please decrease 
the size of headers and please decrease the vertical 
spacing between lines and around headers.
===============================================
