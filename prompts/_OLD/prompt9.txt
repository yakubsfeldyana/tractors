I have a simple static website in directory "website"
It uses several html pages. They need images.
I have put images in subdirectory "website/images"
For each product page I put 3 or 4 images.
We need to add them to corrersponding html product page.

For example, for John Deere 1025R we have 4 images:

john-deere-1025r-1.jpg
john-deere-1025r-2.jpg
john-deere-1025r-3.jpg
john-deere-1025r-4.jpg

We need to add them to page

john-deere-1025r.html

Also the 1st image should be used on the home page
where we list all products.

Please add images to all product pages and the home page.

When adding images into html please specify the size
of the image on the page. This size may be different 
that that of actual image - this is OK.
