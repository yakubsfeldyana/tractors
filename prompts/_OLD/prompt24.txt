I have a simple static website in directory "website"
It uses several html pages.
The page contact.html has a contact form. When the form is submitted, the message is delivered. However,  the form shows error. 
Find out what makes this error message appear. Fix it please.
=======================================================
When the contact form is tested using test_server.py local host, it works correctly.
When we open the website by doubleclicking on index.html, the message is not delivered.
Please fix.
=======================================================
Now the form gets submitted but we have 2 problems.
1. the browser goes to this url: https://web3forms.com/success
we don't want the form to open this URL on submit, we want to remain on the contact form page.
2. We recieve duplicate emails. When we test by doubleclicking index.html or by running test_server.py, either way we recieve 2 identical emails. 
Please fix so that we recieve only one email per submission and remain on the contact form page.
