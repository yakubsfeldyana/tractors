The website menus (navigation) should not be hardcoded into each html page.

The navigaion menus should be implemented separately - and included on top of each page

The menus has to change from regular menu to "hamburger" menu at narrow windows

When testing locally, the website should be tested in two ways:
 - using a local webserver (python script)
 - starting website by double-clicking on index.html "home page" file

The javascript should be plain javascript without including any specialized frameworks

The website should work on MacOS, Linux, and on CloudFlare pages.
